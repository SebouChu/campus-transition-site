abstract: >-
  This report presents RECONNECT’s final policy recommendations and proposals for amendments to the European Union’s (EU or Union) founding Treaties, as well as to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Charter). The suggested changes aim to strengthen democracy and rule of law in the EU, recognizing the Union’s potential to use its fundamental values to reconnect with citizens and, thus, bolster transparency and legitimacy for the European project. The report is to be read in conjunction with RECONNECT’s new narrative for European integration, which also highlights the importance of fundamental values, such as democracy and the rule of law, in the everyday life of European citizens.
