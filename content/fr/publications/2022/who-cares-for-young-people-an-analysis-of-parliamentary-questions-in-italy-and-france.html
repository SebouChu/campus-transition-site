abstract: >-
  The representation of young people (aged between 18 and 35) in parliaments has long interested political scientists because it constitutes an essential component of a well-functioning democratic system. While much of existing scholarly work focuses on the underrepresentation of young people among MPs and elected officials, there is still a lot to be learned about their substantive representation. This paper aims at contributing to this debate by focusing on the extent, how and why MPs use a classical tool such as parliamentary questions to explicitly cater to their younger constituencies. The empirical analysis will provide a comparison of youth substantive representation in two countries, Italy and France, that feature, respectively, one of the oldest and youngest societies in advanced European democracies. They have also shown remarkable differences in the characteristics and evolution of their party systems. Moreover, the two countries have also been affected by the economic crisis in the early 2010s in a very different way. The paper uses new data on oral parliamentary questions in the two countries spanning more than two decades. The comparative research design will allow us to identify whether the salience of youth-related issues is affected by differences in parties’ ideologies, voters’ age structure and age composition of the parliamentary group. By focusing on the causes of youth’s underrepresentation, this study shed light on the dynamics of political representation and democratic quality, as well as the internal functioning of legislatures in difficult times.
